The digital clocks we typically use doesnt help people visualize the passing of time. Recent research by the Association for Computing Machinery, titled "Towards Accessible Remote Work: Understanding Work-from-Home Practices of Neurodivergent Professionals'' (published on 22 April 2021), delved into the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent professionals working from home. A notable observation was the strategies these individuals employ to cope with time agnosia. For instance, one participant used a peripheral timer or clock to maintain a heightened awareness of time so she doesnt lose track of it.  

If you've ever felt the dissonance of 'time blindness' or “time agnosia”,  you're not alone, especially among those with neurodivergent conditions like ADHD. The typical digital clock may not truly resonate with your perception of time. This is where Progtimize steps in! We offer a revolutionary linear digital clock that visualizes the day's progression, complemented by customizable task progress bars. Although there are physical progress clocks that exist, a digital version that is easily accessible is still lacking. Along with adding tasks on the website, you can also import it from your daily calendar with ease! 

From the team:

This hackathon marked a significant milestone for our team, as it was not only our inaugural hackathon but also our very first foray into full-stack development. The journey was undoubtedly challenging, yet we embraced the learning curve with determination and perseverance, continually acquiring new skills as we progressed.

Throughout this exciting endeavor, we harnessed an array of powerful tools and technologies, including:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React
Node.js
MongoDB
Express
Google Cloud
Google Calendar API
and Flask

These tools not only empowered us but also enabled us to create innovative solutions and deliver a remarkable performance during the hackathon.
